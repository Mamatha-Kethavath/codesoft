# Codsoft Internship Projects

This repository contains the projects I completed as part of my Web Development Internship at Codsoft.  
The tasks include:

- **Portfolio Website (HTML & CSS)** – Showcasing my profile, skills, and projects.  
- **Landing Page (HTML & CSS)** – A responsive and visually appealing beginner-friendly page.  
- **Calculator (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)** – A functional calculator performing basic arithmetic operations.  
- **Job Board (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)** – A platform for posting and applying for jobs.

Each project demonstrates my ability to work with core web development technologies and build fully functional interfaces.  
Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback!
